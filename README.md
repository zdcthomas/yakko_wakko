# Installation

## Brand-new box!

On a totally brand-new machine, run:

```bash
sudo softwareupdate -i -a
xcode-select --install
bash -c "`curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zdcthomas/yakko_wakko/master/remote_install.sh`"
cd yakko_wakko/
bash install
```

If you already have git installed, then just:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zdcthomas/yakko_wakko.git
cd yakko_wakko/
bash install
```

## Before you fork!

Give
[this](https://www.anishathalye.com/2014/08/03/managing-your-dotfiles/#dotfiles-are-not-meant-to-be-forked)
a read. It's sums up my thoughts pretty well on forking dotfiles. Dotfiles, to
me, are the honed tools of your craft, they take time care and personal
attention to set up, get right, and maintain, and while using someone else's
tools is fine at first, they should always just be a jumping off point.
